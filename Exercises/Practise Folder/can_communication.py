'''Arduino Communication: Ensure that your Arduino is properly connected to the Raspberry Pi, and you have code on the Arduino side to read the battery
                    data and send it to the Raspberry Pi. This might involve using a serial communication protocol (UART) or any other suitable method.

CAN Bus Configuration: Make sure that your CAN bus interface is properly configured on both Raspberry Pi A and Raspberry Pi B. The can0 in the code
                    assumes that the CAN bus interface is named 'can0'. You might need to adjust this based on your setup.

Data Format: The data format being sent over CAN is a string ("Voltage: 5V, Current: 2A, Power: 10W"). Ensure that this format aligns with your
                    requirements and that both the sender and receiver understand and can parse this format correctly.

Error Handling: Consider implementing error handling mechanisms, such as exception handling, to handle potential issues with the CAN bus communication or
                    data parsing.

Data Rate: Adjust the sleep duration in the sender script (time.sleep(1)) based on how often the Arduino updates data. If the Arduino sends data more
                    frequently, you may want to reduce this duration.

Hardware Connection: Ensure that your CAN transceiver and wiring are correctly set up on both Raspberry Pi A and Raspberry Pi B.'''
